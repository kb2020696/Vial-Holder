These files are copyright of LM Designs and may be freely distributed to, and the devices manufactured by, any person who agrees to the following conditions:
1. That any device produced is given freely to any medical professional that requires it with the exception that private individuals may ask for a small charge to cover the actual cost of the materials used.
2. Should any profit be made from the manufacture that it be donated to a charity that supports the families of front line personnel of any type. 

The files provided are AMF (Additive Manufacturing Format) that enable the device to be printed on any 3D printer after conversion to machine specific code by a suitable slicer such as CURA or the derivative provided by the machine manufacturer.

Since it is likely that the specific dimensions of the device will not be suitable for all situations these are the actual CAD drawings so that individuals and/or organisations may adapt it to their purposes. In this case the same conditions apply that this is not for profit and any money generated be donated to charity. The original files and the AMF files were generated using FreeCAD. Anyone using these is encouraged to support the organisation (www.freecadweb.org) by making a donation.

Each part of the 8 parts of this device will automatically be printed with the word COPY instead of a part number.
