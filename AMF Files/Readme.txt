1. That any device produced is given freely to any medical professional that requires it with the exception that private individuals may ask for a small charge to cover the actual cost of the materials used.
2. Should any profit be made from the manufacture that it be donated to a charity that supports the families of front line personnel of any type. 

The files provided are AMF (Additive Manufacturing Format) that enable the device to be printed on any 3D printer after conversion to machine specific code by a suitable slicer such as CURA or the derivative provided by the machine manufacturer.

Since it is likely that the specific dimensions of the device will not be suitable for all situations the actual CAD drawings are be made available so that individuals and/or organisations may adapt it to their purposes. In this case the same conditions apply that this is not for profit and any money generated be donated to charity. The original files and the AMF files were generated using FreeCAD. Anyone using these is encouraged to support the organisation (www.freecadweb.org) by making a donation.

Each part of the 8 parts of this device will automatically be printed with the part number. 
The design is intended for use with 3ml or 1ml syringes and vials of 22mm diameter or larger.
The design is easy to modify to use different syringes, vials and needle types with access to the original CAD files. 



Suggested printing instructions

1. This is optimised to print on an extrusion printer. Alterations may be necessary to print on a resin printer.
2. Material:-  This is easiest to print using PLA. The colour of the material is up to the printer or the final user.
3. Print quality:- Since this is intended to be multi-use but essentially disposable if enough are available. The print quality may be lowered to improve printing speed.
4. Slicer settings:- Using PLA on a non glass bed all the parts can be printed wihout brims, platforms or supports. The body, slider and reducer may require a brim depending on the bed and/or machine. All the other parts can be printed without adhesion brims or platforms or supports. Using a glass bed the body, slider and reducer  will require a brim.
5. The following slicer settings are suggested:  Wall thickness 1.5 to 2mm. Interior fill –default (usually 15%) for all parts except the body (#001) and the reducer (#008). These two items are very thin and require a 100% fill. You will require to change the fill % in the advanced or expert settings in the slicer to do this.
 

Files provided

There are 10 files provided in ZIP file.
Download the ZIP file and extract the files. 

Readme.txt – Contains these instructions
Details.pdf – Contains a detailed description and diagram of the parts. It also gives instruction of how to use the device.

The remaining files are in Additive Manufacturing Format (AMF) to make the 3D printing process machine and slicer independent.
The AMF files:-
Body -001 – main body
Slider -002 – slide section
Spacer -003 to Spacer -006 – Spacer parts of different thicknesses
Pad -007  - Vial location pad – specific to 22mm diameter vial
Reducer -008 – Reducer sleeve to allow the device to be used with 1ml syringes.
